# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on a page for Diddy Kong. I went back through a few kew tutorials in FreeCodecamp. Added styles, and an image. Progressed on Basic CSS (22% complete).

**Thoughts**: Visual Studio is a really neat program. It predicts what I want to do, and automatically creates </> when I make an element. I am happy to be making something on my own, and using what I learned with a project. Otherwise, I would have forgotten literally everything by now (and it's only been 4 days).

### Day 3: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Minimal. Struggled finding a way to write HTML on my computer. Attempted using Brackets, but then discovered that I can use Microsoft Visual Studio through my school (or even NotePad). Started making a page for Diddy Kong.

**Thoughts**: Brackets looked really cool, but it did not work for me. The screen did not always work like I wanted, it said I did not have permission to save files in the default location, the preview button only works with Chrome, and I could not save my work as an HTML document. I was bothered by that, and decided to look for alternatives. I felt a bit silly when I realized that I already had a couple of programs already on my computer. I started working with Visual Studio, and eventually started making a page. I feel like I forgot almost everything I learned in the Basic HTML course, and I think I will do it again and make my own website as I go through it.

### Day 2: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learning Basic HTML, started Learning Basic CSS. Considering starting a tribute page to use the skills I am learning so far. Completed the tutorial for Github.

**Thoughts**: It felt good to complete basic HTML. I am looking forward to learning basic CSS and trying to create a tribute page. Learning Github has been challenging to me - this is a whole new world that I never experienced before! I am excited to see where it takes me, and I hope I can continue to stay committed even when I move and start a new job.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 1: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created GitHub account, Created FreeCodeCamp account, completed 90% of Learning Basic HTML

**Thoughts:** Since this is all new to me, I decided to include tutorials as my time coding, otherwise I would be here forever and burn out quickly.
