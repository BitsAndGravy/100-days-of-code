# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created GitHub account, Created FreeCodeCamp account, completed 90% of Learning Basic HTML

**Thoughts:** Since this is all new to me, I decided to include tutorials as my time coding, otherwise I would be here forever and burn out quickly.

**Link to work:** None

### Day 2: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learning Basic HTML, started Learning Basic CSS. Considering starting a tribute page to use the skills I am learning so far. Completed the tutorial for Github.

**Thoughts**: It felt good to complete basic HTML. I am looking forward to learning basic CSS and trying to create a tribute page. Learning Github has been challenging to me - this is a whole new world that I never experienced before! I am excited to see where it takes me, and I hope I can continue to stay committed even when I move and start a new job.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
